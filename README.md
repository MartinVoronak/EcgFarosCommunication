## Android bluethoot Server Client communication 
# bluetoothServerClient

@Autor_note:
This code was made due to incomplete snippets of codes. As a junior programmer I didnÂ´t understand everything at first 
so I created this prototype. Feel free to use it as you wish, just have in mind its purpose was to quickly build bluetooth
communication, not to deliver pretty well fucntioning code.

###### functions:
- [x] list paired device
- [x] pair with discovered devices 
- [x] select paired device for communication
- [x] start communication channel as server
- [x] connect communication channel as client
- [x] send predefined messages via buttons
- [ ] send custom messages
