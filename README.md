# Android bluethoot Server Client communication 

@Autor_note:
This code was made due to incomplete snippets of codes. As a junior programmer I didnÂ´t understand everything at first 
so I created this prototype. Feel free to use it as you wish, just have in mind its purpose was to quickly build bluetooth
communication, not to deliver pretty and well fucntioning code.
